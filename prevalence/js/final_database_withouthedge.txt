21390:163	and that really made it a very interesting, uh, show to where you never really knew which, which one --n4044b4 was going --n4044c3 to show up. you know, whether it was going to, where they're going --n40450e to be real close --n404525 or whether they're just going --n404544 to be partners --n404557, you know	###Yeah , E_S ###I think -NONE- most shows were doing that , E_S ###and then they went away from it E_S ###SpeakerA67*t67 . ###Uh-huh .

21448:96	and and, well, of course, another one of their mistakes, i think --n405e2d, is they have a tendency --n405e50 to change characters, or to change the characters', uh, uh, personalities well, especially after they get married --n405eb3.	###SpeakerB86*t86 . ###\[ I did n't , \+ I was going -N40577F to say , -NONE- I did n't \] ever watch MOONLIGHTING , E_S ###SpeakerA87*t87 . ###well -NONE- go ahead .

21517:53	do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret --n40777e, or at least they keep it quiet --n4077a5.	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA115*t115 . ###and I think -NONE- they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about -N4070AC . E_S ###SpeakerB116*t116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117*t117 . ###So . I always thought -NONE- that was kind of weird .

E_S ###SpeakerA36*t36 . ###Unfortunately there are often these correlations that -N401C6A are inverse of what they should be -N401C8D like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals -N401CC4 , there are more policemen E_S ###SpeakerB37*t37 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA38*t38 . ###but that 's which -N401E4D came first . E_S ###SpeakerB39*t39 . ###Yeah .

99028:72	so we don't know what --n403076 is really going on, what --n403095 is, uh, really the range of sentences or awards that --n4030cc are, uh, are actually, uh, in the end applied --n403107.	###I mean not everybody \[ is , \+ you know , has , \] \+ has \] the right morals sometimes .

E_S ###SpeakerB25*t25 . ###and sometimes that 's not real fair either , though E_S ###so , E_S ###SpeakerA26*t26 . ###Well , one of the others things that -N40285C gets me \[ on , \+ on \] the juries is that often in the newspaper , \[ I , \+ I \] tend -N4028C3 to hear two things \[ that , \+ well , that \] -N4028EE go on .

99064:18	and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.	###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA40*t40 . ###Well , that 's where , uh , the role of juries \[ is , \+ is \] restricted -N404136 -N40413D E_S ###and , I 'm not sure -NONE- I 'd want -N40422F to change that aspect of it , E_S ###one is , -NONE- it 's restricted -N404310 in the sense that , juries only decide the charges that -N404343 are actually , uh , brought -N404362 , you know E_S ###SpeakerB41*t41 . ###Right .

99075:72	but often juries hear only a fraction of the, of the story when they have --n404d64 to decide guilt or innocence --n404d7f.	###SpeakerA40*t40 . ###Well , that 's where , uh , the role of juries \[ is , \+ is \] restricted -N404136 -N40413D E_S ###and , I 'm not sure -NONE- I 'd want -N40422F to change that aspect of it , E_S ###one is , -NONE- it 's restricted -N404310 in the sense that , juries only decide the charges that -N404343 are actually , uh , brought -N404362 , you know E_S ###SpeakerB41*t41 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerB43*t43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44*t44 . ###Uh , such like , maybe in murder they get -N40476C to choose whether it 's , uh , premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees . E_S ###The other thing that juries are restricted -N4048C4 on -N4048CF \[ and , \+ and \] at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things \[ in my , \+ even in my \] own experiences , that you usually do n't get -N40495A to hear all the information .

E_S ###SpeakerA59*t59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60*t60 . ###But that 's another subject E_S ###but , E_S ###SpeakerA61*t61 . ###Well , that 's probably true .

156857:70	uh, so do, do you think it --n403567's more important to spend money on research or for support of, uh, people.	###Right . E_S ###Yeah .

157011:154	and, you know, i, i think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things --n403f08, they're always talking about, you know, uh, --n403f3f feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it,	###I think -NONE- it 's mainly , -NONE- people , like , they get the vengeance of it . E_S ###SpeakerB34*t34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well it 's also , E_S ###SpeakerA35*t35 . ###Because , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB36*t36 . ###I used -N40383B to live in Georgia E_S ###and , you know , \[ the , \+ the \] big thing down there was , all right , we have capital punishment , E_S ###but if you look at who -N4039DC gets accused -N4039EB and who -N4039FA are the ones who -N403A11 actually get executed -N403A24 , it 's very racially related and ethnically related , E_S ###SpeakerA37*t37 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###SpeakerB38*t37 . ###SpeakerA39*t39 . ###it 's \[ mainl- , \+ lot of \] blacks .

157037:38	and why, does it just turn out --n404db9 to be genetic or biochemical in origin --n404ddc.	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA43*t42 . ###SpeakerB44*t44 . ###Right E_S ###and that , E_S ###and , you know , also by -NONE- keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we do n't currently do this , of -N404888 making restitution .

157389:42	and basically, uh, we were going --n402cb3 to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.	###SpeakerB22*t22 . ###And progressive tax , I think -NONE- -N40258B , uh , does not give people incentive -N4025B2 to make more money , E_S ###and what I mean -N402691 by that , the more income -NONE- you make -N4026BC , the more tax you pay -N4026DB .

E_S ###There was that , E_S ###SpeakerB44*t43 . ###SpeakerA45*t45 . ###which -N403762 can- , E_S ###was it Jerry Brown , E_S ###one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for -NONE- doing away with all \[ the , \+ the \] tax codes -NONE- they have -N403844 now and implementing \[ a f- , \+ I think a flat \] percentage , something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB46*t46 . ###Yeah , E_S ###if you \[ impl- , \+ implemented \] a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , -N403A7A to make more money E_S ###and \[ the , \+ \] what people need -N403B75 to understand -N403B84 in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . E_S ###SpeakerA47*t47 . ###Uh-huh .

157474:125	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.	###Yeah , E_S ###actually , \[ I , \+ I \] agree that that 's an interesting thing .

157511:153	well, the, the one thing that i know --n402ae2 does seem --n402af1 to happen from people i've talked to --n402b1c on this, is that in the situation you just said --n402b53 where it's nine to three, or some such number --n402b86, that there's, an effect --n402bad starts --n402bb8 being that there's starts --n402bd3 being a lot of peer pressure going on	###SpeakerB13*t13 . ###I would like -N401F0A to do that .

157526:224	some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict --n403672, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in --n4036cd knowing that nothing they could do --n4036f0 could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for --n403733 or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict.	###SpeakerB17*t17 . ###Uh-huh .

157948:33	i, i think working mothers or mothers who --n402642 choose --n40264d to work outside the home, um, need very early --n402680 to come to grips with any guilt, that they feel --n4026b3 and decide what --n4026c6's best for them and their family.	###Usually busy -NONE- fighting for survival .

158077:187	and i think that the people who --n401771 are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level. uh, you know, whether it be a biblical force, uh, you know, the eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a knife, life type logic or just, uh, uh, some sort of anger at putting peop-, putting, uh, murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life, uh, while we foot the bill.	###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA5*t5 . ###Of the statements made -NONE- by people against \[ the , \+ the \] death penalty , um , \[ I , \+ I \] like the statement made -NONE- by Cuomo -N4008EC .

162718:32	it was always my impression that the justice himself, or herself, had the final say.	###but , uh , E_S ###and I also think , just like you were talking about -N4028BE before , why you were chosen -N4028DD to be on a jury -N4028F8 that , uh , \[ the , \+ just , \] \+ the \] process of -NONE- picking jurors is not always objective .
