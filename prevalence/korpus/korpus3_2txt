67512:40	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west.	###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA58*t58 . ###Bicycling is really big here . E_S ###I did n't know that , \[ and , \+ \] you know , until I came down here , and , kind of caught the fever . E_S ###SpeakerB59*t59 . ###Wow . E_S ###SpeakerA60*t59 . ###SpeakerB61*t61 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###I mean , generally in the Midwest it seems -N4041F7 to be \[ less , \+ much less . \] E_S 	i mean, maybe it's because of the winters. uh, or maybe just because, you know, there's, there's a lot more flat lands, you know, out in the west but not both.
81953:37	i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other,	###Uh-huh .

23449:67	and maybe instead of, of, uh, just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do, maybe we should commit to spend a week,	###\[ I , \+ I \] really agree with the , uh , innocent until -NONE- proven -N4004EA guilty theory .

E_S ###SpeakerA3*t3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4*t4 . ###But for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . E_S ###SpeakerA5*t5 . ###Uh-huh .
