E_S ###SpeakerB101*t101 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] was trying -N404B2A to remember , E_S ###there was a court case , uh , here where I live -N404BE2 , just a few months ago . E_S ###The city workers , they wanted -N404CB3 to , um , E_S ###the city government wanted -N404D35 to institute the random drug testing E_S ###SpeakerA102*t102 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB103*t103 . ###and the city workers , uh , took them to court -N404DF1 to protest , -N404E04 saying that it invaded \[ their , \+ I guess , \[ first a- , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] search and seizure amendment E_S ###SpeakerA104*t104 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB105*t105 . ###and it 's still tied -N405025 up in the legal channels . E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	yes	yes	S	no
112322:27	in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that --n401f1e said that.	###SpeakerA47*t47 . ###So , we went to El Sorrento . E_S ###SpeakerB48*t48 . ###Ha- , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###have you ever , um tried Pappasito 's . E_S ###SpeakerA49*t49 . ###It was fun . E_S ###SpeakerB50*t49 . ###SpeakerA51*t51 . ###You know , what . E_S ###\[ This is , \+ that 's \] real funny -NONE- you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church E_S ###and Bob pointed to it E_S ###and he said , `` I keep -N401CD6 hearing good things about that place , E_S ###we 're going -N401D86 to have -N401D95 to go .

78975:34	you know, i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis.	###that was , E_S ###SpeakerA61*t61 . ###Ferraro . E_S ###SpeakerB62*t62 . ###yeah E_S ###Ferraro . E_S ###That was a while ago , E_S ###that was a couple elections ago , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63*t63 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerB64*t64 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's okay . E_S ###SpeakerA65*t65 . ###Well , that 's what I mean -N402CA9 , E_S ###like I did n't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was -N402D45 . E_S ###SpeakerB66*t66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67*t67 . 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
98771:31	and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say, you know, back then there were the opium dens	###and he was \[ a d- , \+ d- , \] \+ a District \] Attorney before , and a prosecutor before -N4032A1 \[ becoming , \+ becoming \] mayor . E_S ###So that 's a really stran- , E_S ###you know , it 's a different viewpoint . E_S ###I , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA60*t60 . ###You know , in a sense \[ I do n't , \+ I 'm n- , \] \+ I have \] real mixed feelings on that E_S ###SpeakerB61*t61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA62*t62 . ###because it comes a bit from the angle that the , uh , uh , E_S ###it would certainly be an interesting test E_S ###SpeakerB63*t63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64*t64 . ###but the other side of it , to me , E_S ###SpeakerB65*t65 . ###What -N40380C happens if we lose worse . E_S ###SpeakerA66*t66 . ###Uh , y- , E_S ###well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
123350:27	i don't know that it would or wouldn't.	###You pay a ten percent income tax . E_S ###SpeakerA77*t77 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB78*t78 . ###That 's what you pay -N403B33 E_S ###if you make forty million dollars , uh , then you 're going -N403BBC to pay four million . E_S ###SpeakerA79*t79 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB80*t80 . ###I- , E_S ###if you make forty dollars , you 're going -N403CD2 to pay four dollars . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] that 's it . E_S ###SpeakerA81*t81 . ###Yep . E_S ###So \[ that , \+ that 's \] it . E_S ###That 's E_S ###I mean \[ I , \+ I \] agree with that E_S ###that 's a good idea E_S ###and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected -NONE- \[ or , \+ or \] lower them or what . E_S ###SpeakerB82*t82 . 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
73888:61	so, i'm trying --n4028d7 to think of anything else that --n4028f6's changed over the last ten or twenty years.	###I guess , -NONE- when I was growing up -N402220 , \[ it was , \+ it -N402243 was \] still the ideal -NONE- to \[ get a , \+ get a \] home and buy house , E_S ###MUMBLEx and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever E_S ###SpeakerA51*t51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52*t51 . ###SpeakerA53*t53 . ###Yeah E_S ###SpeakerB54*t54 . ###you know , you just do n't buy a house , E_S ###SpeakerA55*t55 . ###just because they ca n't get into one , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###the ways -NONE- our tax laws and stuff are structured -N402673 -N40267A , you ca n't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways , E_S ###SpeakerB56*t56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57*t57 . ###so . Yeah , E_S ###\[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a good point E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	no
19930:37	i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy.	###Well , because that 's where my folks all came from -N406C63 . E_S ###SpeakerB128*t128 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA129*t129 . ###And they had a centennial here awhile back . E_S ###I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND , E_S ###that was pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB130*t130 . ###Well , E_S ###SpeakerA131*t131 . ###That was part of that trilogy that , uh , Bruce Canton did -N406E8C . E_S ###SpeakerB132*t132 . ###Now \[ that 's one that , \+ That 's one \] E_S ###SpeakerA133*t132 . ###SpeakerB134*t134 . ###I do n't know . E_S ###See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago . E_S ###SpeakerA135*t135 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB136*t136 . 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
173565:96	uh, you know, we've had, i guess --n4020c0, laws against, uh, you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, i guess.	###SpeakerA11*t10 . ###SpeakerB12*t12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13*t13 . ###Of course , if he 's fallen in love with drugs and there is n't anything but -NONE- getting stoned or high \[ is , \+ is \] the only thing in life that -N4012F6 seems -N401301 to be meaningful , then maybe there is no hope . E_S ###SpeakerB14*t14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15*t15 . ###What 's your , uh , feeling -N40152C . E_S ###SpeakerB16*t16 . ###Uh , well \[ I guess -NONE- I , \+ I guess -NONE- I 'm \] probably a little more \[ to , \+ toward \] the other direction . E_S ###SpeakerA17*t16 . ###SpeakerB18*t18 . ###Uh , well I guess , -NONE- mainly because , uh , \[ it 's , \+ I , \] E_S ###well , like there 's two sides to it I guess -NONE- -N401813 . E_S ###Uh , one is that , uh , if you 're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it 's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability -NONE- to function , then \[ I , \+ I \] think \[ that , \+ that , \] you know , I do n't have any problem at all with -NONE- testing that individual , you know , on the spot . E_S ###Uh , but I guess -NONE- I feel more like whatever you 're doing -N401D25 in your own private life is your own private business . E_S ###Uh , and I guess -NONE- part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem -N401E94 to come and go . E_S ###You know , we had prohibition for awhile E_S ###and then we did n't have prohibition . E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S-N4020C0	no
14300:70	so, we decided --n405459 to try it because prior to that all we got --n40548c were things like glamour or sports illustrated.	###Uh , here 's -N404A78 what -N404A83 went on in Asia over the past week , E_S ###and there 's maybe a page of that , little brief paragraphs , unless that was \[ one of their , \+ the focus of their \] main stories . E_S ###SpeakerA61*t61 . ###That sounds good E_S ###if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick . E_S ###SpeakerB62*t62 . ###Uh , it too is one those MUMBLEx E_S ###in the interest of efficiency we all have -N404E31 to find ways , E_S ###and I do most of my reading in the bathroom . E_S ###SpeakerA63*t63 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB64*t64 . ###Um , and it 's one of those that I can \[ ei- , \+ read either \] an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I 'm going -N404FFA to spend -N405009 in there -N405018 . E_S ###SpeakerA65*t65 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB66*t66 . ###And it just seems -N4051E8 to fit nicely , so that I can get it read -N40521B in about three days . E_S ###SpeakerA67*t67 . ###Well , we 're working on a NEWSWEEK , uh , E_S ###for the last couple of months we got , you know , an introductory subscription , E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
46686:76	i mean, i've seen --n4012c2 and i've had friends that --n4012e1 have, uh, like, uh, --n401308 eighty-one or eighty, uh, celicas,	###SpeakerA13*t13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14*t14 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerA15*t15 . ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] true , E_S ###it 's definitely true because , E_S ###SpeakerB16*t16 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] that 's one reason E_S ###\[ I , \+ uh , I 've \] had no problems with my Subaru , E_S ###that -N400E6C 's one reason -NONE- I went with it -N400E93 because \[ I , \+ \] Subaru had a good reputation , uh , for , you know , low maintenance , E_S ###so . E_S ###SpeakerA17*t17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , Honda does too , E_S ###that 's why I was really , E_S ###SpeakerB18*t18 . ###Well , really , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] no question E_S ###but you have a nineteen , E_S ###I mean , I 've got -N40121A to see if , E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	no
91368:81	um,. i think it depends on if you want --n406725 to be a, if you want a regional job or a national job,	###and when I , E_S ###now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs -N406050 , E_S ###I was going -N406103 to be a teacher , E_S ###I was just a high school teacher , E_S ###so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , E_S ###SpeakerB88*t88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89*t89 . ###you know , but then when I went , um , for graduate work , you know , or for a new job -N4062F2 , people said to me , you know , Shippensburg State , E_S ###where is that -N40645E , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB90*t90 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA91*t91 . ###And , you know , when I went into higher education -N406529 , even at other universities , they were n't aware of it , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB92*t92 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93*t93 . ###So I think yeah , E_S ###that 's important , E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
14141:68	i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves. um, since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends --n4010db to be extraordinarily trite.	###I do n't usually have time -NONE- -NONE- to read the newspaper everyday -N40035E , E_S ###so I try -N400408 to listen to the radio in the morning \[ and , \+ and \] try -N40043F to catch one of the morning talk shows , E_S ###and then I usually end up -N400575 flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening .
