E_S ###I mean \[ our , \+ uh , our , \] \+ our \] glorious , uh , you know , mayor here in Washington is six days away from -N402DA5 getting \[ out of , \+ out of \] the can E_S ###and , uh , you know , \[ he , \+ he \] tried -N402F75 to appeal his conviction . E_S ###Uh , and , you know , it did n't work . E_S ###But be that as it may -NONE- , everybody who -N4030F6 got enough money will pump the appeal process dry . E_S ###Uh , \[ in , \+ in \] the old days , you know , and say round about times of battle of Hastings , you know , and the villages if you were a transgressor , \[ they , \+ they \] either , you know , drove you out in the woods E_S ###or you became a ward of somebody E_S ###and \[ he , \+ you \] were his slave . E_S ###SpeakerB20*t19 . ###SpeakerA21*t21 . ###And if he did n't like what you did -N40358D , he killed you . E_S ###And \[ that has , \+ that 's \] pretty effective . E_S ###Uh , you know , it 's not good for civil rights , I guess -NONE- -N403705 , E_S ###but it 's pretty effective in that , you know , you 've got -N4037E4 to get along in the community E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	no	no	no	yes	S	no
157474:125	and i, i don't think it --n401077 would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal.	###Yeah , E_S ###actually , \[ I , \+ I \] agree that that 's an interesting thing . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] believe -NONE- \[ that 's a , \+ \] \[ for , \+ for \] civil suits it 's not unanimous , right , E_S ###but \[ for , \+ for \] criminal suits it 's unanimous by federal law . E_S ###SpeakerA4*t4 . ###I do n't know if it -N400595 's even true that it 's always unanimous because I thought -NONE- there were cases \[ where , \+ uh , I do n't know if it 's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where \] it -N40062C was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve -N400667 . E_S ###SpeakerB5*t5 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I actually thought -NONE- I 'd read that , too E_S ###and that 's why I phrased it that way -N40099C . E_S ###SpeakerA6*t6 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB7*t7 . ###I wonder , E_S ###\[ the difference , \+ yeah , the difference \] could be that for , uh , \[ state , \+ if there is such a thing , state \] felonies versus federal felonies that \[ federal , \+ things that -N400AF3 are under federal \] jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , E_S ###and things that -N400CE0 are under state jurisdiction , even criminal do n't require , E_S ###but I do n't know what \[ the , \+ the \] laws , E_S ###do you think that that 's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous . E_S ###SpeakerA8*t8 . ###Well , I 'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for \[ a , \+ an \] acquittal is -N400F6D . E_S 	yes	yes	no	no	no	yes	no	no	yes	S	no
967:82	um, the, the other side of that might be if, if someone found out something --n403a7d or surmised something --n403a90 that --n403a9b weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense.	###Uh , if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something -NONE- you do n't know -N403364 about it , well , then I guess -NONE- one could assume -NONE- one was invaded -N4033AB E_S ###SpeakerA33*t33 . ###uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh .
